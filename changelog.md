## [0.7.0] - 2023-02-14

### Added

- Support for compilation to Souffle/C++ (`--codegen` option).

### Changed

## [0.6.0] - 2022-08-31

### Added

- Support for `bv_to_int`, `int_to_bv`, `bv_extract`, and `bv_concat` formula
  constructors.
- More string manipulation and inspection functions (`substring`,
  `string_length`, `char_at`, `string_to_list`, `list_to_string`,
  `string_to_i32`, and `string_to_i64`).
- Allow argument annotations in relation declarations.
- Option to output relations to disk (`@disk` annotation).
- Explicit annotation `@edb` for EDB relations.

### Changed

- New and improved command line interface.
- New syntax for relation declarations (`rel` instead of `input` and `output`).
- Removed `@external` annotation (replaced by `@disk`).

### Fixed

- Incorrect (non-`smt`) types for formula constructors.
- Various lacunae in documentation.
- Various bugs (including some type checking bugs).

## [0.5.0] - 2020-11-15

### Added

- Give line numbers with parse exceptions.

### Changed

- Signature of `get_model` (takes a list of propositions now)

### Fixed

- Bug in the naive (call-reset) SMT solver strategy.
- Bug in `let fun` expressions.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-22

### Added

- Eager semi-naive evaluation algorithm.
- SMT manager that uses push and pop.
- Naive SMT manager that does not do any form of caching.
- Optimal index selection.
- Ability to interface with different solvers and set logic.

### Changed

- Accept .tsv fact files instead of .csv files.
- Allow ML variables to be lowercase.
- The `debugSmt` option logs SMT calls to separate files by solver, instead of
  printing them to same stream.
- Removed `is_valid_opt` and changed signature of `is_sat_opt` to take a list
  of `bool smt` terms.

### Fixed

- Concurrency bug in the memoization of parameterized constructor symbols.
- Bug in the recording of rule evaluation diagnostics.
- Bug in the "freshening" of `let fun` expressions.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-02-03

### Added

- Support for `fold` terms.
- Options to restrict which results are printed after evaluation.
- Nested, variable-capturing functions (i.e., `let fun` expressions).
- Added generic serialization function `to_string`.
- Preliminary (and undocumented) option to compile Formulog program to C++
  instead of interpreting it.

### Changed

- Do not require parentheses around tuple types.
- Do not reorder literals in rules (in order to preserve soundness of
  flow-sensitive type checking).
- Changed the names of some string-related built-in functions (`strcat` is now
  `string_concat` and `strcmp` is now `string_cmp`).
- Removed built-in function `string_of_i32`.

### Fixed

- Made Antlr parser faster by simplifying grammar.
- Changed precedence of infix cons operator (i.e., `::`).
- Added parameterized constructor symbols to fix type soundness issues arising
  from the non-determinate type signatures of some formula constructors.
- Made type checking flow-sensitive to soundly handle destruction of
  user-defined constructors in formulas.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-25

### Added

- Support wild card term `??` when "invoking" predicates as functions.
- Constant array constructor `array_const` (from Z3's theory of arrays).
- Ability to do partial magic set rewriting with annotations `@bottomup` and
  `@topdown`.
- Demand transformation simplification for magic set rewriting (following Tekle
  and Liu [2010]).
- Support for record types.
- Support external input facts via annotation `@external`.
- Support sequential runtime (for debugging) via `sequential` system property.
- Support existential anonymous variables in negated atoms.

### Changed

- Increased the amount of information printed with the `debugMst` option.
- Allow ML-style expressions to occur as logic programming terms.
- Prefix names of automatically-generated ADT testers and getters with `#`.
- Removed syntax highlighting for solver variables.
- Don't require periods after declarations and function definitions.
- Print thread name during SMT debugging.
- Make sure that the same SMT call is never made twice (with the same timeout).

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with applying type substitutions that contain mappings to (possibly
  nested) type variables.
- Updated name of formula type in Vim syntax file.
- Fixed a couple bugs in SMT-LIB parser.
- Fixed bug with missing case in unification algorithm.
- Boolean operators now short circuit.
- Reject programs that use top-down rewriting in combination with IDB predicates
  in the ML fragment.
- Make sure that EDB relations are maintained during top-down rewriting, even
  when they are only referenced in the ML fragment.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-04-21

### Added

- Everything (initial release).
