Check out our academic papers to learn more about the science behind Formulog.

## Formulog Language Design 

Our [OOPSLA'20 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428209) introduces Formulog, motivates its language design, and demonstrates its use through three extensive case studies.

## Formulog Performance 

Our [OOPSLA'24 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689754) describes speeding up Formulog via 1) compilation to Souffl√© and 2) eager evaluation, a novel Datalog evaluation strategy that works well for some SMT-heavy workloads.

## Short Papers

For more information on how Formulog interfaces with external SMT solvers, see the ICLP'20 extended abstract [Datalog-Based Systems Can Use Incremental SMT Solving](https://arxiv.org/html/2009.09158v1/#EPTCS325.7) by Aaron Bembenek, Michael Ballantyne, Michael Greenberg, and Nada Amin ([PDF available here](https://aaronbembenek.github.io/papers/datalog-incr-smt-iclp2020.pdf)).

For an introduction to Formulog geared towards an audience already well versed in Datalog, see the Datalog 2.0'22 short paper [Formulog: Datalog + SMT + FP](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3203/short2.pdf) by Aaron Bembenek, Michael Greenberg, and Stephen Chong.
