# Welcome to Formulog!

Formulog is a programming language that extends the logic programming language Datalog with SMT solving and first-order functional programming.
Formulog was designed to be a domain-specific language for implementing SMT-based program analyses, like refinement type checking and symbolic execution.
But who knows---maybe it will also have other uses!
